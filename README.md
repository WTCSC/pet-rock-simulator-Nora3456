The objective of this pet rock simulator is to keep your pet rock happy, full, and clean. Overdoing or underdoing any of these tasks will cause your pet rock to be taken away from you and the game will end.

The first question asks you to name your pet rock. After naming your pet rock you will be put into a cycle of 4 questions that influence (good or bad) your pet rocks stats. To answer the question type in any letter 1-4 (5 if you want to end the game) that corresponds with that question, then press enter after typing your decision. Each question either brings up your pet rocks stats by 1, or drops your pet rocks stats by 1. By having your pet rocks stats go over 10, or drop below 1 the cycle wil end and you will be shown your pet rocks fate. The game/cycle will also end if you type 5 and click enter.
